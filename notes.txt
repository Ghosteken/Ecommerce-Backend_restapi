Given that your Express application is running on http://localhost:3000, here are the request URLs for each operation:

Create a new customer:

POST request URL: http://localhost:3000/customers

Delete a customer by ID:

DELETE request URL: http://localhost:3000/customers/:customerId
Replace :customerId with the actual ID of the customer you want to delete.
Update a customer by ID:

PUT request URL: http://localhost:3000/customers/:customerId
Replace :customerId with the actual ID of the customer you want to update.
Get all customers:

GET request URL: http://localhost:3000/customers
Get a single customer by ID:

GET request URL: http://localhost:3000/customers/:customerId
Replace :customerId with the actual ID of the customer you want to retrieve.
Make sure to use the appropriate HTTP method and request URL for each operation when interacting with your Express application's API endpoints.
